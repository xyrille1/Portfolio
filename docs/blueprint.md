## Style Guidelines:

- Color scheme: Dark theme, embodying professionalism and a tech-forward aesthetic, as initiated in the provided HTML. The current text and muted colors will be retained in both dark and light schemes.
- Primary color: A rich, professional blue (#3385ff) to symbolize sophistication and technical proficiency. This hue provides clarity and strong visual anchoring.
- Background color: A subtle dark gray with a hint of the primary hue (#0e1115), ensuring focus on content while maintaining depth suitable for a dark scheme.
- Accent color: A deep indigo/purple (#4d40b3) selected as an analogous complement to the primary blue, offering visual interest and highlights for interactive elements without disrupting the main color harmony.
- Headlines and body text: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, for its modern, clean, and objective aesthetic, mirroring the original request.
- Monospace elements (like local time): 'ui-monospace' as per the original HTML, offering a distinct and legible font for code-like text or timestamps.
- Icon library: Lucide icons are used exclusively, providing crisp, modern, and customizable vector icons across the interface, as indicated in the original design.
- Grid system: A responsive content grid that displays a single column on small screens and expands to a two-column layout on larger screens, ensuring optimal content readability across all devices.
- Section visibility: A 'section-fade' animation with a smooth translateY effect for sections entering the viewport, providing a sophisticated and engaging content reveal.
- Interactive elements: Subtle hover effects on interactive components like skill tags, social links, and inquiry items, providing visual feedback and enhancing user interaction.
